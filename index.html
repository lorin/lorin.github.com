<h2>about me</h2>
<p>
I'm a Lead Architect at <a href="http://www.nimbisservices.com">Nimbis Services</a>.
I'm interested in increasing the productivity of computational scientists and engineers by making it easier for them to use large-scale computational resources for scientific and engineering applications, especially cloud computing resources. I'm also involved in the <a href="http://openstack.org">OpenStack</a> project, where I'm on the Doc Core team.

</p>
<p>
  Once upon a time, I studied software developers to understand what problems they face and to evaluate whether proposed technologies actually make their lives easier. Nowadays, I
  develop software instead of studying how others do it.

<p>
  I received a PhD in computer science from the University of Maryland (2006), an M.S. in electrical engineering from Boston University (2002), and a B.Eng. in computer engineering from McGill University (1999). I was an assistant professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in the Computer Science &amp; Engineering department from 2006-2008.  I was a
  computer scientist at USC/ISI in the <a href="http://apex.isi.edu">Adaptive Parallel EXecution (APEX)</a> Computing Group from 2008-2011.
